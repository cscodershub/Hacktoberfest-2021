# Random Password Generator
## Methodology
- The password generator GUI is build using visual studio. In visual studio I have used the basic window form to design the GUI which uses windows netframework behind the scene to run the application
- The GUI is designed using the friendly interface i.e. Drag and Drop of visual studio 2019.
- For the working of application C# is used for all the algorithm and coding purposes.
- To generate pseudo random number The Middle Square method is used which can generate n digit random number. And for taking the seed or starting number the function of C# which returns the millisecond from the current time is used.
- To copy the generated password to clipboard we are using the Clipboard function of the C#.
