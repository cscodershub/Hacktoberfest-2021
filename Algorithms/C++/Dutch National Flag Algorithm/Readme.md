## Dutch National Flag Algorithm
The flag of the Netherlands has three colors: Red, white, Blue in the same
order. So, if given balls of these colors, we need to arrange them so that balls of the
same color are placed together.

In programming, we represent the problem as:

We are given an array of 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s; we have to sort this array such that all 0s
appear first, followed by all 1s, and finally all 2s. We can traverse the array only once,
and no extra space should be used.

E.g. Input: 2021002

Output: 0001222
